			<p> Transport yourself back to the 50's using this JukeBox, and relax to some songs of your choice. This website was created using the teamâ€™s previous knowledge of Java, specifically using JavaFX to implement the GUI. Additionally, the team integrated HTML and javascript that they learned thorugh the Technica Workshops.</p><p>This JukeBox was created by Sahana Raju, Selena Alvarado, Lauren Kosub, Kaitlin Leung, and Rachel Walter. All five students are freshman at the University of Maryland and are enrolled in the Advanced Cybersecurity Experience for Students Honors College Program. Technica is their first hackathon, and they look forward to more projects in the future!</p>
